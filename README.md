Selenium script for automation in python.

This project is for automating some websites written in Python.
To run the script make sure you have downloaded the chromedriver or any other browser driver
to interact with browser and move the chromedriver.exe file to the main project directory.

->Install the required libraries by running the following command in terminal:

                                    pip install selenium
                                    pip install pandas
                                    pip install openpyxl
                                    
If that does not work for you please run the following commands:

                                    py -m pip install selenium
                                    py -m pip install pandas
                                    py -m pip install openpyxl
